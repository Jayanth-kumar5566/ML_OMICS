    <h1> The Question </h1>
    <par> We are trying to understand if a person's microbiome can act
    as a <em>biomarker</em> for the bronchiotitis diseases, or in
    otherwords we are trying to find if these microbiomes can predict
      some <em>clinical factors</em> of the person.
</br>
<h2> How do we go about it </h2>
<par> To find if it is a biomarker or not we need to compare the
  microbiome of the patient and the healthy control. If there is a
  <em> Consistent,Significant </em> change in them, then we may
  conclude that it is a biomarker.</br>

  We have two types of profiles,
<ul>
  <li> Fungal Microbiome</li>
  <li> Bacterial Micrombiome</li>
</ul>
</br>

Assume that these profiles are biomarkers then they should be able to
predict the clinical outcomes of the patient to establish this fact, we
need to come up with a score for clinical variables(Which I think, Is
already) derived by somebody(to fill up). </br>

<h4> June 06 </h4>
Feature selection for microbial and fungal profiles </br>
</br>
<strong>Test 1 :</strong> </br> Take a few healthy and patients fungal
profile and eyeball them to see if there is any visible difference.</br>
<strong> Could not find any visible difference </strong>

<h4> June 07 </h4>
To find clusters in bacterial profile

</br>
Step 1: Removing rows that have atleast one missing values </br>
Step 2: Run a 3-D PCA on the dataset</br>
Step 3: Run a 2-D PCA on the dataset</br>

Step 4:
<strong> Coloring the PCA plots based on the disease measures </strong>
</br>

Step 5: Copy pasted the disease measures </br>
Step 6: Added "0" in the column of DSI to the Control's </br>

Step 7: Created 3D-PCA and labeled them based on disease severity
Mild,Moderate and Severe </br>
