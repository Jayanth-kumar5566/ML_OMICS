Joining Bacterial and Fungal

Undersampling results

1. Accuracy varies between 45 to 78 and the mean accuracy is 55. Normally distributed

2. Accuracy varies a lot since the undersampling or chooing of under samples depeneds upon the seed and its
randomly sampled at each iteration, and the acuracy varies since at each iteration different samples are 
choosen for training and testing together

Oversampling Results

1.SMOTE was applied for the oversampling, then the number of exacerbations was converted to the the groups
called Frequent Exacerbations and Non-frequent exacebators

2.The accuracies followed normal distribution and varies between 58 to 83 and the mean is 70

 
Only Bacterial with SMOTE

1. Average Accuracy is 58.19 varies between 39 to 69

Only Fungi with SMOTE

1. Average Accuracy with Fungi only is 53.47 and varies between 40 to 65
